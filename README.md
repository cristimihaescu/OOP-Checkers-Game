OOP Checkers - Java

Overview:
The OOP Checkers Java Game is a digital implementation of the classic board game of checkers, also known as draughts, where two players take turns moving their pieces diagonally across the board until one player captures all of their opponent's pieces or blocks their opponent's pieces from moving. The game is implemented using object-oriented programming principles in Java.

Getting Started:
To play the game, first, make sure you have Java installed on your computer. Then, download the game's source code and open it in an IDE that supports Java.

To start the game, run the Game.java file. This will launch the game's graphical user interface.

Gameplay:
The game starts with all of the pieces set up on the board in their starting positions. The players take turns moving their pieces diagonally across the board, either one square forward or capturing an opponent's piece by jumping over it diagonally. 

The game ends when one player captures all of their opponent's pieces or blocks their opponent's pieces from moving. The player with the most pieces left on the board at the end of the game wins.

Game Rules:

    The game can be played in two-player mode.
    The players can choose the board size (10-20).
    Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward one space, capturing their opponent's pieces by jumping over them.
    A piece can only jump over an opponent's piece if there is an empty space behind it.
    Capturing is mandatory and players must capture as many of their opponent's pieces as possible in a single turn.
    The game ends when one player captures all of their opponent's pieces or blocks them from making any moves.

Conclusion:
The OOP Checkers Java Game is an engaging and interactive way to play the classic board game in a digital format. It provides an opportunity to test your strategic skills and compete against other players.
